  <div class="talk"><div class="meta">09:00</div><h2 class="title">Functor calculus and multiparameter persistence</h2><div class="speaker">Bjørnar Gullikstad Hem</div><div class="abstract">In this talk, I will introduce a new framework, poset cocalculus, which is a variant of functor cocalculus that is defined for functors from a poset to a model category. The motivation for this framework lies in the relevance for multipersistence of functors from posets to the model category of chain complexes over a field, as any multipersistence module is the homology of such a functor. I will present several applications of poset cocalculus, including showing that the Vietoris-Rips filtration is the degree 2 approximation of the Čech filtration, and that the interval decomposability of a middle-exact bipersistence module is a consequence of the fact that any degree 1 bipersistence module is interval decomposable.</div></div>

  <div class="talk"><div class="meta">09:00</div><h2 class="title">A free lunch: manifolds of positive reach can be smoothed without decreasing the reach</h2><div class="speaker">Hana Dal Poz Kourimska</div><div class="abstract">Assumptions on the reach are crucial for ensuring the correctness of many geometric and topological algorithms. However, these assumptions are often
coupled with the requirement that the manifold be smooth, typically at least
C^2. We recently proved that any manifold with positive reach can be approximated arbitrarily well by a C^\infty manifold without significantly reducing the reach. This result implies that nearly all theorems established for C^2 manifolds with a certain reach naturally extend to manifolds with the same
reach, even if they are not C^2, for free! I will present this result in more detail and touch upon the techniques we used to prove it --- partitions of unity and smoothing with convolution kernels.</div></div>

  <div class="talk"><div class="meta">10:00</div><h2 class="title">On the connectivity of intrinsic Čech complexes of spheres</h2><div class="speaker">Ekansh Jauhari</div><div class="abstract">Let S^n be the n-sphere with the geodesic metric and of diameter π. The intrinsic Čech complex of S^n at scale r is the nerve of all open balls of radius r in S^n. In this talk, I will explain how to control the homotopy connectivity of intrinsic Čech complexes of spheres at each scale between 0 and π in terms of coverings of spheres. The upper bound on the connectivity, which is sharp in the case n=1, comes from the chromatic numbers of Borsuk graphs of spheres. The lower bound is obtained using the conicity (in the sense of Barmak) of Čech complexes of the sufficiently dense, finite subsets of S^n. These bounds imply the new result that for n≥1, the homotopy type of the Čech complex of S^n at scale r changes infinitely many times as r varies over (0,π). </div></div>

  <div class="talk"><div class="meta">11:00</div><h2 class="title">Open Applied Topology: A fast, flexible, user-friendly tool for matrix algebra in TDA</h2><div class="speaker">Gregory Roek</div><div class="abstract">Many problems in TDA have solutions in homological — and indeed, linear — algebra.
However, it's challenging to harness these solutions, computationally. Matrices are often large, having millions or billions of rows and columns. They are indexed by simplices, rather than integers. They have coefficients in abstract fields and require exact numerical accuracy. They have unusual sparsity patterns.
This talk will introduce an open-source library to address some of these problems, Open Applied Topology (OAT).
OAT is a high-performance linear algebra solver with a user-friendly front end. It allows the user to perform mathematical operations including matrix/vector addition, multiplication, and factorization (R=DV, RU=D, U-match), and to compute persistence diagrams, barcodes, (optimal) (co)cycle representatives, and induced maps. Users can easily link the library to new types of chain complexes (simplicial, cubical, etc.), and to Python libraries such as SciPy. In sum, OAT is a user-friendly tool for matrix algebra in TDA.
If time remains, we will examine broader trends in TDA software development across the research landscape (government, private, academic), and opportunities for future growth and cooperation.</div></div>

  <div class="talk"><div class="meta">11:30</div><h2 class="title">G-Mapper: Learning a Cover in the Mapper Construction</h2><div class="speaker">Kang-Ju Lee</div><div class="abstract">The Mapper algorithm is a visualization technique in topological data analysis (TDA) that outputs a graph reflecting the structure of a given dataset. However, the Mapper algorithm requires tuning several parameters in order to generate a "nice" Mapper graph. This paper focuses on selecting the cover parameter. We present an algorithm that optimizes the cover of a Mapper graph by splitting a cover repeatedly according to a statistical test for normality. Our algorithm is based on G-means clustering which searches for the optimal number of clusters in k-means by iteratively applying the Anderson-Darling test. Our splitting procedure employs a Gaussian mixture model to carefully choose the cover according to the distribution of the given data. Experiments for synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our algorithm generates covers so that the Mapper graphs retain the essence of the datasets, while also running significantly faster than a previous iterative method. </div></div>

  <div class="talk"><div class="meta">11:30</div><h2 class="title">Equivalence of Landscape and Erosion Distances for Persistence Diagrams</h2><div class="speaker">Cagatay Ayhan</div><div class="abstract">This talk is based on our recent work arXiv:2506.21488, which establishes connections between three of the most prominent metrics on persistence diagrams in topological data analysis: the bottleneck distance, Patel's erosion distance, and Bubenik's landscape distance. Our main result shows that the erosion and landscape distances are equal, thereby bridging the former's natural category-theoretic interpretation with the latter's computationally convenient structure. The proof utilizes the category with a flow framework of de Silva et al., and leads to additional insights into the structure of persistence landscapes. Our equivalence result is applied to prove several results on the geometry of the erosion distance. We show that the erosion distance is not a length metric, and that its intrinsic metric is the bottleneck distance. We also show that the erosion distance does not coarsely embed into any Hilbert space, even when restricted to persistence diagrams arising from degree-0 persistent homology. Moreover, we show that erosion distance agrees with bottleneck distance on this subspace, so that our non-embeddability theorem generalizes several results in the recent literature.</div></div>

  <div class="talk"><div class="meta">12:00</div><h2 class="title">Optimal persistent homology representatives for data growing over time</h2><div class="speaker">António Leitão / Nina Otter</div><div class="abstract">Persistent homology (PH) is one of the main methods used in Topological Data Analysis. An active area of research in the field is the study of appropriate notions of PH representatives, which allow to interpret the meaning of the information provided by PH, and is thus an important problem in the application of PH, and in the study of its interpretability. Computing optimal PH representatives is a problem that is known to be NP-hard, and one is therefore interested in developing context-specific optimality notions that are computable in practice. Here we introduce  time-optimal PH representatives for data that grows over time, i.e., where new data points may be added but not deleted as time passes, allowing one to extract representatives that are close in time in an appropriate sense. We illustrate our methods on point clouds arising from embeddings of univariate time series, and on temporal networks, using synthetic data, as well as time series arising from climate models, and temporal networks originating from money-laundering models. We show that our methods provide optimal PH representatives that are better suited for these types of problems than existing optimality notions, such as length-optimal PH representatives.</div></div>
